## Logo Use
The Primary Logo features an amalgam of symbols from across different times, domains, and contexts, each with their own meaning. These different meanings coalesce into a gestalt that questions meaning itself, and this diversity speaks to the universality of Semiote as a platform for exploring symbols.

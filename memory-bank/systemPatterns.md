# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
Web-based application with a backend for image processing and a frontend for user interaction.

## Design Patterns
Consider using MVC for the web app, and possibly microservices for scalability.

## Component Structure
- Image processing
- User management
- Symbol database
- AI integration
- Semiote management: Storing and managing user-defined symbols within the system.

## Data Flow
Images and symbols flow from user input to processing and storage.

## State Management
Use a state management library like Redux for the frontend.

## Error Handling
Implement robust error handling for image uploads and processing.

## Performance Considerations
Optimize image processing and database queries.
